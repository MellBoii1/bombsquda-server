# BombSquda Server
The flask server backend for various BombSquda related things
As it says on the tin, it's a website/backend so that not only can you learn about
what BombSquda is, but it can also be used for online functionality!
(such as syncing spaz tickets and tokens, making purchases with said currency, linking with spazbot, etc...)
Don't know what BombSquda or SpazBot is? Check out the links below!<br>

## So, how do I run this server?
You'll likely need a networking system like [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com)
so you can host any servers running locally (this) to anywhere. You can port forward 
or do whatever, but this is the method I went with since it's easier.
Once you got that down, just run server.py (or startup.bat if you have tailscale) and the server will run.
If you're running your own local server to use in BombSquda, you'll have to go into fromgoverhaul/mell_resources, 
and change server into whatever address you're using to host the server.<br>
## Can I make some changes to this repo? Like as with BombSquda?
Yes, totally! I accept some nice new additions once in a while :)

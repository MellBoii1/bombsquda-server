# BombSquda Server
The flask server backend for various BombSquda related things
As it says on the tin, it's a website/backend so that not only can you learn about
what BombSquda is, but it can also be used for online functionality!
(such as syncing spaz tickets and tokens, making purchases with said currency, linking with spazbot, etc...)
Don't know what BombSquda or SpazBot is? Check out the links below!<br>
